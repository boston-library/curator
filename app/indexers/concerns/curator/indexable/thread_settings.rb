module Curator
  module Indexable
    # An object that is stored in Thread.current to represent current indexing/writing settings,
    # used to implement Curator::Indexable.index_with
    #
    # The public API is that Curator::Indexable.index_with calls:
    # * ThreadSettings.push(settings) to register current settings
    # * ThreadSettings.current.pop at end of block to un-register them
    #
    # Then code in Curator::Indexable can check `ThreadSettings.current` to get
    # the current ThreadSettings. It returns a "null object" representing no
    # settings if there are none, so calling code can do things like:
    #
    #     ThreadSettings.current.disabled_callbacks?
    #
    # and
    #
    #     ThreadSettings.current.writer
    #
    # without worrying about if there are current settings.
